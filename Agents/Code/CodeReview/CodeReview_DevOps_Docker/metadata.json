    "shortDescription": "Performs code review for essential Docker-related project files.",
    "fullDescription": "This agent validates the presence of key Docker-related files—build.py, docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, and requirements.txt—within a project directory. It uses the autogetlocalfilecontent tool to retrieve each file and ensures they exist before proceeding. If any file is missing, the agent automatically hands off the task to the corresponding specialized agent responsible for generating or fixing that specific file.",
    "UseCases": "- Ensuring all necessary Docker configuration files are present in a project\n- Automating the delegation of tasks to specific agents for missing files\n- Improving reliability and completeness of Docker-based environments"
